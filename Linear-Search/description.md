### Linear Search

> Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm used to find an element in a list or array. It works by iterating through each element in the list, one by one, and checking if it matches the target value. The algorithm continues until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached. Linear Search has a time complexity of `O(n)`, making it efficient for small lists but less efficient for large datasets.
