### Binary Search

> Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted list or array. It works by dividing the list in half and comparing the target value to the middle element. If the target value matches, the search is complete. If not, the algorithm repeats the process on the appropriate half of the list until the target value is found. Binary Search has a time complexity of `O(log n)`, making it much faster than Linear Search for large datasets.
